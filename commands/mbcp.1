[\fB-r\fR]
[\fB-v\fR]
[\fB-n\fR]

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBmbcp\fR is a parallel version of the standard \fBcp\fR command,
designed to copy large files or large numbers of files\(emor even
large numbers of large files\(emby distributing the work across a set
of computers that share a filesystem.  It can copy
.TP 1m
\(bu
a single file to a single file,
.TP 1m
\(bu
a single directory to a single directory, or
.TP 1m
\(bu
one or more files and/or directories to a directory.
.LP
\fBmbcp\fR is a \fBbash\fR script that uses MPI-Bash functions for
communication.  It should therefore be run like any other MPI program
(typically with \fBmpirun\fR or \fBmpiexec\fR).
.SH OPTIONS
\fBmbcp\fR accepts only a subset of \fBcp\fR's options:
.TP 1c
\fB-r\fR
Copy directories recursively.
.TP 1c
\fB-v\fR
Explain what is being done.
.TP 1c
\fB-n\fR
Do not overwrite an existing file.
.TP 1c
\fB-P\fR
Never follow symbolic links in \fIsource\fR.
.TP 1c
\fB-p\fR
Preserve file mode, ownership, and timestamps.
.TP 1c
\fB-a\fR
Same as \fB-P\fR \fB-p\fR \fB-r\fR.
.LP
In addition, at least one source file or directory and exactly one
target file or directory must be specified on the command line.
.SH EXAMPLES
Use 16 processes to copy one file to another:
.LP
.RS
\fCmpirun -np 16 mbcp my_giant_file their_giant_file.BAK\fR
.RE
.LP
Use 128 processes to copy one directory to another, with verbose
reporting:
.LP
.RS
\fCmpirun -np 128 mbcp -r -v /scratch/me/big /usr/projects/myproj/big
.RE
.LP
.SH BUGS
I sometimes see segmentation faults when MPI-Bash programs exit.  I
don't know why.
