# This script sets two environment variables then invokes the script
# named on the command line.  First, it sets MPIBASH_PLUGIN to the
# full path of the mpibash.so file.  This saves scripts from having to
# hard-wire the path.  Instead, they can load MPI-Bash simply with
# "enable -f $MPIBASH_PLUGIN mpi_init".  Secondly, it sets LD_PRELOAD
# to MPIBASH_PLUGIN.  This is a workaround for a workaround in Open
# MPI.  Basically, we need to make sure that Open MPI's dlopen() takes
# precedence over the default dlopen(), and to do that, Open MPI has
# to be loaded into memory before bash.  See
# http://www.open-mpi.org/faq/?category=troubleshooting#missing-symbols
# for a discussion of the "deep run time linker voodoo" that makes
# this trickiness necessary.
